# Inputs Package Overview

Inputs are fields which allow for an input of data, based on a specific and predefined format. Currently, Inputs include the Kendo UI Slider and the Kendo UI Switch components for React.

The Slider lets users select a value from a predefined range. The values can be increased or decreased over a pre-defined step by dragging a handle along the track, or by clicking the side arrow buttons. The component supports two modes of display&mdash;horizontal and vertical.

When initialized, it shows the currently selected value. Users are able to slide or click the control to reveal the second value.
